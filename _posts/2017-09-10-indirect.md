`mov ( $1234_5678, ebx );` copies the hexadecimal value 0x12345678 into the ebx register.

`stdout.put ( ebx );` would print that hexadecimal value.

`stdout.put ( [ebx] );` would print the 32-bit value that is stored at the memory location 0x1234_5678.

Caveats about whether or not accessing data at that memory address is allowed.
