title: Signed and unsigned... hmmm
---

Today's reading included bits about twos complement and how numbers may be signed or unsigned. This seems wrong to me. Unsigned numbers have a sign, all of them are positive. Signed numbers have both positive and negative numbers. There are no unsigned numbers, only mixed signed (pos and neg) and positively signed only.

I know, pedantic.
