In chapter four, Hyde introduces a variety of data types and declarations,  
including how to declare and use constants, scalar variables, integers, reals,  
"data types", pointers, arrays, records/structures, unions and namespaces.  

Hyde's HLA includes the concept of constants, as I understand them -- a named  
element assigned some value that cannot change during compilation or execution.  
But oddly, HLA includes *VAL*s as well. These are "constants" that can change  
value during compilation and execution. What distinguishes them from normal  
variables, isn't clear to me yet.
